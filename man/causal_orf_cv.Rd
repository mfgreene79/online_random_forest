\usage{
causal_orf_cv(x, y, treat, numClasses, numRandomTests, counterThreshold,
  maxDepth, numTrees, numEpochs, nfolds, type = "classification",
  method = "gini")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of features on which to generate predictions.  Must be equal to `numFeatures` when forest was initialized.}

\item{y}{Matrix of classes with one column.  Multiclass classification is supported.  Must be integers and a matrix.}

\item{treat}{Matrix of treatment assignments.  Must be values of 0 or 1 in a matrix with one column.}

\item{numClasses}{Number of classes expected to be classified.}

\item{numRandomTests}{Number of random tests, i.e., number of features to be selected at each node for evaluation.}

\item{counterThreshold}{Threshold for number of observations before a split will occur.}

\item{maxDepth}{Maximum depth for each tree.}

\item{numTrees}{Number of trees in the forest.}

\item{numEpochs}{Number of epochs for processing during each training step.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of folds for cross validation.}

\item{type}{Type of Random Forest.  Only `classification` is implemented at this time.}

\item{method}{Method used for determining if a node should split.  Implemented methods are `gini` for Gini Impurity or `entropy` for entropy.}
